## Project Overview

In this project I am tasked with assisting a friend,  W.Avy, to assess weather data for a prospective location that he is wanting to examine prior to opening an ice cream and surf shop on the Island of Oahu. W.Avy may want to open other shops around the islands so he has requested that the work be well documented and easy to duplicate the next time we may want to analyze a new location. SQLite was used to store the weather data provided by W.Avy while utilizing SQLAlchemy to connect to the data. Since surfing activities and ice cream sales will be driven by warm, sunny weather, W.Avy wants to analyze the precipitation levels as higher occurences of rain will yield negatively impact potential revenue. The weather data provided by W.Avy was converted into a database and then sorted by date and limited to the previous year's data. Matplotlib was used to create visuals for his upcoming board meeting that would accurately reflect the weather patterns in Oahu. Beyond plotting the precipitation patterns, W.Avy needed statistical analysis of the precipatation figures for the year. I expanded upon his request to also include temperature figures and to convert this into a histogram to display the previous year's temperature data. In order to ensure the data was accessible for the board members, I had to utilize Flask in order for the information to be accessible via a website. For Deliverables 1 and 2 W.Avy requested to have weather analyzed for June and December to assess the year-round viability of the business.
